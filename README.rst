nbd
===

A lightweight ipython/jupyter notebook diffing tool.

Purpose
-------

This tool makes ipython/jupyter notebook diffs more readable.

This tool is meant for text-based diffing from the command-line.

Overview
--------

Running ``ndb`` shows differences in the following types of data:

-  Python code
-  reStructuredText code
-  Resource files (e.g. PNGs)

This will show you most of what has changed in the ``In[1]:`` and
``Out[1]:`` lines of the notebook.

The output of ``ndb`` is
`git-diff <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff>`__ output and can be piped
to other commands like `less(1) <https://linux.die.net/man/1/less>`__
and `tee(1) <https://linux.die.net/man/1/tee>`__.
