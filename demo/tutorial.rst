nbd tutorial
============

This tutorial assumes you've already taken the steps to build and install `nbd`.

The tutorial explains:
1. how `nbd` exports notebooks to different formats on demand
2. how the user can diff a notebook easily and relatively quickly

Check for changes
-----------------

Lets start by changing the working directory to the `demo/`
directory in the repo, e.g.:
```
[demo@nbd]$ cd ~/workspace/nbd/demo
```

Run as follows:
```
[demo@nbd]$ nbd demo.ipynb
```

There was no output, so we conclude there was no diff to the file. Git confirms:
```
[demo@nbd]$ git status
On branch demo
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Displaying notebook changes
---------------------------

Below, we'll demonstrate that `nbd` can make it easy to see
resource file modifications in addition to RST and Python changes.

First, change the ipynb source file via quick and dirty find-replace:
```
[demo@nbd]$ perl -pi -e 's/2 \* np.pi/2.1 \* np.pi/g' demo.ipynb
```

Then:
1. open this demo.ipynb notebook up with `jupyter notebook`
2. re-run all code blocks to regenerate outputs
3. re-save the file

Run nbd and pipe to `less(1)` to shows a pretty readable diff:
```diff
[demo@nbd]$ nbd demo.ipynb | less

So we see the `np.linspace` code's args change as expected.

If we continue scrolling, the `nbd` diff is much more readable than
if we try to git-diff the demo.ipynb source code directly with git.
Try it out with `git diff demo.ipynb`. You'll see a ton of lines that
only display changes to the image binary file code inline.
The notebook's image changed since the arguments passed to
`np.linspace` end up changing the image generated by the code.

So where's the image code in the `nbd` diff? Scrolling down to the
end of the diff, we see a PNG (`demo__demo.ipynb__output_3_0.png`) has changed:
```diff
[demo@nbd]$ nbd demo.ipynb | tail -n 5

```

We can also easily pass through an option to the `git-diff` command
in order to exclusively view files that have changed:
```
[demo@nbd]$ nbd demo.ipynb --git-diff-options="--name-only"
2017-09-28 02:40:21,157 - INFO - nbd: git diff output below (no output == no diff)
/var/folders/c1/83dlqbss5w7gh3ywffq3yb600000gn/T/tmpOkukrd/new/demo__demo.ipynb.py
/var/folders/c1/83dlqbss5w7gh3ywffq3yb600000gn/T/tmpOkukrd/new/demo__demo.ipynb.rst
/var/folders/c1/83dlqbss5w7gh3ywffq3yb600000gn/T/tmpOkukrd/new/demo__demo.ipynb__output_3_0.png
```

This shows there are Python, RST, and PNG file changes to our notebook.
